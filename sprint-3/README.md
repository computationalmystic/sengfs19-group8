# Sprint 3 Readme

---

### Sprint 3 Goals and Additions:
- Front end completely functional with charts/visualizations implemented
  - charts loaded with sample data if server is still blocked
- Add another endpoint
  - could be an improvement to one of the repo comparison visualizations
  - could a small function added to the homepage, similar to insights in the default augur Vue app
- Back-end server should be functional with sample data loaded into the augur database
 - If the server is not functional, then it should work locally on a VM
