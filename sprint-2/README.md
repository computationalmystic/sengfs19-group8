# Sprint 2 Readme

---

### Sprint 2 Goals and Additions:
- Create the basic UI for the second use case, including a basic homepage that leads to each to individual metric.
  - ChartJS
- Create the structure of the metric function, including name and the SQL needed.
- OPTIONAL: See if we can get the UI and API working in sync, this will help as a base for the two other metrics

---

### Work Items
1. Build a functional front-end
  - Homepage and 3 metric UI pages
2. Code at least one new metric along with metric function(s), and endpoints
  - can't test until public IP ports are open
3. Get production server set up, along with being able to run with no errors
